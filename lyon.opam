synopsis:
  "A comprehensive framework for analyzing termination in graph rewriting systems"
description:
  "This project enhances termination analysis for arrow-labeled multigraph rewriting systems by building on the techniques developed by Bruggink et al. and Endrullis et al. It introduces a machine-checkable condition that accounts for multiple edges, addressing limitations of previous methods and simplifying termination proofs."
